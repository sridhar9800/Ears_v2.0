# EARS_v2.0

## Installation

1. Install Linux.
2. Checkout this repository.
3. Install proper ruby version with `rbenv`.
4. Install `bundler` gem globally.
5. Type `bundle install` to install ruby gems.
6. Type `yarn` to install js packages.
7. Run `rails db:migrate`.

## Running

1. Connect GM3156 sonometer via USB if you want to collect records.
2. As far as I remember just run `foreman`. It uses `Procfile` to run both backend (rails) and frontend (webpack-dev-server) at once. 


## Future ideas

1. Definitely considering implementing RubyBrain. No clue whether I have the time for that now.
